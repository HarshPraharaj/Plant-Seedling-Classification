# Plant-Seedling-Classification

Used pre-trained VGG16, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 networks to extract bottleneck features
and build a model on top of each of them to evaluate and compare the model performances.
(Model performances include classification report, confusion matrices, plots of Loss Vs Epochs)

Optimized models using TF-Lite (Post Training Dynamic range quantization)
